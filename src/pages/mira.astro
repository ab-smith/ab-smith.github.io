              As cybersecurity practitioners, we have firsthand experience with
              the challenges of performing risk analysis for our clients. We
              have seen how difficult it can be to fit into existing, complex
              processes that ultimately end up being a waste of time and
              resources, but also starting from scratch each time to duplicate
              the same complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mira was born out of these experiences. We recognized the need for
              a risk management platform that could simplify the process and
              provide actionable insights. What started as a small project for
              our internal needs quickly became a comprehensive solution that we
              knew could benefit many organizations facing similar challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              We saw a gap in the market for an intuitive, comprehensive, and
              cost-efficient tool that could help organizations handle their
              cybersecurity risks effectively. We believe in risk-driven
              methodologies and are confident that Mira can make a significant
              difference in how businesses approach risk management and enhance
              their overall security posture.

              >
              regardless of the risk analysis methodology, we all produce the same
              content with the same intent, and MIRA helps you focus on that. It
              also serves as a safeguard to focus on what matters and avoid getting
              lost in one approach's specifics.

              <span class="font-semibold text-emerald-500">Intuitive:</span> we believe
              that the best way to make a tool intuitive is to make it simple. We
              have designed Mira to be as straigntforward as possible through multiple
              iterations and interaction with cyber security practitioners.

              <span class="font-semibold text-emerald-500">Comprehensive:</span>
              we have designed Mira to be a one-stop shop for all your risk management
              needs. The best way to achieve this is to provide a platform that can
              be used by all stakeholders involved in the risk management process
              and reduce the context switching as much as possible.

              and switching and instead use the catalogs and previous analyses to
              focus on the content.
