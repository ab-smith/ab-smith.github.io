          Why are we even bothering to create another risk management software?
        </div>
        <div class="text-align">
          <p>
            As cybersecurity practitioners, we have firsthand experience with
            the challenges of performing risk analysis for our clients. We have
            seen how difficult it can be to fit into existing, complex processes
            that ultimately end up being a waste of time and resources, but also
            starting from scratch each time to duplicate the same complexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mira was born out of these experiences. We recognized the need for a
            risk management platform that could simplify the process and provide
            actionable insights. What started as a small project for our
            internal needs quickly became a comprehensive solution that we knew
            could benefit many organizations facing similar challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            We saw a gap in the market for an intuitive, comprehensive, and
            cost-efficient tool that could help organizations handle their
            cybersecurity risks effectively. We believe in risk-driven
            methodologies and are confident that Mira can make a significant
            difference in how businesses approach risk management and enhance
            their overall security posture.

      <!-- Principles -->

        <div class="text-xl font-semibold">Principles</div>
        <div class="text-sm mb-4">
          The building principles that make MIRA unique
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Approach-agnostic:</span> regardless of the
          risk analysis methodology, we all produce the same content with the same
          intent, and MIRA helps you focus on that. It also serves as a safeguard
          to focus on what matters and avoid getting lost in one approach's specifics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Intuitive:</span> we believe that the best
          way to make a tool intuitive is to make it simple. We have designed Mira
          to be as straigntforward as possible through multiple iterations and interaction
          with cyber security practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Comprehensive:</span> we have designed Mira
          to be a one-stop shop for all your risk management needs. The best way
          to achieve this is to provide a platform that can be used by all stakeholders
          involved in the risk management process and reduce the context switching
          as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Cost-effective:</span> we believe that cybersecurity
          should be accessible to everyone. We have designed Mira to be cost-effective
          for the core features. Power users can also use our customization options
          to tailor the solution to their specific needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Beyond the "spreadsheet":</span> we wanted
          MIRA to be more than another typing tool. It has features to review your
          analysis for coherence, remind you of the deadlines for mitigations, build
          analytics for reporting, and so many more capabilities
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Productivity:</span> the actual value of analysts
          is their expertise in producing a relevant risk analysis. The UI is structured
          to minimize the time spent on formatting and switching and instead use
          the catalogs and previous analyses to focus on the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-semibold">Deployment flexibility:</span> Mira can be
          deployed on-premise or in the cloud, depending on your maturity and constraints.
          We offer a free trial to help you decide which deployment option is best.
